# Pong
Pong Simulator on Python 

This is a project where I used python coding in order to create the retro video game pong which can 
be played by two players using the same keybord utilizing the up and down arrow as Player B and
the "w" and "s" keys for Player A.
The code would need to be utilized in a terminal window and opened utilizing a Python window.
